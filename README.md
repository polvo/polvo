# What the ★★★★?

Polvo is an application assembler for the browser.

*Yet another one*.

<!--
# TL;DR

Tired of reading extensive README's files?

-->

# Seriously?

Yes, built with *simplicity* in mind and based on a *straightforward*
[plugins](#plugins-supported-languages) architecture, Polvo is also agnostic to
languages, libraries, frameworks and weather, like the majority of his
~~competitors~~ friends.

# Philosophy (in short)

 1. Your `scripts` and `templates` become all one `javascript`, and your `styles`
 become one `css`
 
 1. Both `scripts` and `templates` are wrapped as CJS modules and thus can be
 `required` regularly as you'd do in NodeJS.
 
 1. You end up with 2 files, `app.js` and `app.css`
 
Include both in your `html` and you're done!

# Installation

````shell
npm install -g polvo
````

# Dependency Resolution

Polvo uses the same resolution algorithm presented in NodeJS, so you can code
your libraries doing global or local `require`s as you wish, like if you were
building a NodeJS app. In the end, everything will be ready for in-browser use.

> Of couse, you won't be able to use NodeJS core modules once inside the
Browser, such as `fs`, `process`, `cluster` and so on. The same applies to any
other module you may find - if it uses any API not available for in-browser use,
you won't be able to use it.

# Packaging Systems

In order to not lock you up with one single packaging system, Polvo is intended to
support most of them. It's not fully functional yet but the plans are there.

At the moment you can use:

 * NPM (fully supported)
 * Bower (through local/relative `require` calls only)
 * ~~Components~~ (yet to be done)
 * ~~Ender~~ (yet to be done)

These missing may be considered as a TODO-list, in the presented order.

# Plugins (supported languages)

Again, Polvo is agnostic to languages -- however it needs individual plugins
for each language in order to properly assemble it. Some of them is built
in out of the box for you joy, and others should be done / installed separately.

Polvo will search and initialize aditional plugins present in the `dependencies`
field of your `package.json` file.

## Built in plugins

Each plugin is an independent repository.

# Config

Polvo's config file is simply a file named `polvo.yml` in your project.

You'll may need to setup *six* simple options to adjust Polvo to your needs:

 1. [server](#server)
 1. [input](#input)
 1. [output](#output)
 1. [alias](#alias)
 1. [minify](#minify)
 1. [boot](#boot)

A Polvo's complete config file look such as:

## polvo.yml

````yaml
server:
  port: 3000
  root: ./public

input:
  - src

output:
  js: ./public/app.js
  css: ./public/app.css

alias:
  app: ./src/app

minify:
  js: false
  css: false

boot: ./src/app/app
````

### Server

Basic infos to serve your application, just inform desired port and your
`public` folder.

When using the option `-s` a basic webserver will be launched to serve the app.

### Input

Project's input `src` folders, can be one or many.

### Output

Project's output `files`, at least one should be specified.

### Alias

It's a handy option that lets you map some `names` to specific `dirs`. These
names will make folders act like gobal modules in your `node_modules` folder
with all dirs listed in `package.json` directories field, so you can `require`
them as such.

For example, imagine a structure like this:

````
myapp
├── polvo.yml
├── src
│   └── app
│       ├── app.coffee
│       ├── controllers
│       │   └── controller.coffee
│       ├── models
│       │   └── model.coffee
│       └── views
│           └── views.coffee
└── vendors
    └── myframework
        └── src
            └── lib
                ├── controller.coffee
                ├── model.coffee
                └── view.coffee
````

The app's `controller.coffee` can `require` the framework's `controller.coffee`
as easy as:

````coffeescript
Controller = require '../../../vendors/myframework/src/lib/controller'
````

However, sometimes these relative paths can get nasty. In these cases, aliases
can help the way. Imagine this one:

````yml
alias:
  myframework: ./vendors/myframework/src
````

With this, `myframework` folder will act as if it was a NPM module present in
your `node_modules` folder, and `require` calls can be made in global-style
regardless of which file is requiring it:

````coffeescript
Controller = require 'myfraework/lib/controller'
````

Note that:

 1. The `myframework` keywork is the virtual alias in the config file 
 1. It points to the folder `vendors/myframework/src`
 1. So requiring `myframewok/**/*` will be the same as requiring
 `vendors/myframework/src/**/*`
 1. Be cautious while using aliases. For instance if you have have an alias with
  the same name of a module you have in your  `node_modules` folder,  you'll end
  up with serious problems - hopefully you'll notice this immediately.

### Minify

In some cases you may want to disable minification in `release` mode, even
though in both `development` and `release` mode you'll always have a single
`.js` and `.css` file.

So what's the catch?

In `development` mode other things will be injected among your scripts in the
`app.js` file. For example, the LiveReload embedded functionality.

In `release` mode it's removed, nothing special is injected. So you may want to
have a production ready `release` file (that doesn't includes magic), but at the
same time keep it uncompressed. In case you do, that's the way to go.

### Boot

By default, Polvo will wrap all your `scripts` and `templates` in CJS module and
register them all at startup. However, none will be `require`d and therefore
none will be initialized.

You need to specify your app's entry point within the `boot` property. With this
Polvo will do a simple `require` to this file at startup, after everything is
registered.

Following the config presented above, it'd be:

````javascript
require( 'src/app/app' );
````
